Subject: [PATCH] fence_virtd: drop legacy SysVStartPriority from service
 unit
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since systemd-218[1], systemd will emit following lines in the
journal upon (re)loading its configuration:

Support for option SysVStartPriority= has been removed and it is
ignored

As it allegedly had no importance for some time even before, simply
drop it.
